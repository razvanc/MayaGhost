MayaGhost
=========

Blank theme for Ghost blogging platform. It was build to speed up ghost theme development.

It uses less for splitting up the css file so, developers can organize their files more easy. All the less files where structured according the SMACSS principle.

When you try to customize the theme is better, for you to add your css code to less/theme.less file.

This is the first release. I will try to add more functionality to it as we go along with Ghost development.
